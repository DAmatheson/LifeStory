## Coding Standards:

Normal school standards  
Use single quotes around strings in javascript  
Avoid unnecessary extra HTML elements  
Avoid inline styling wherever possible  
Comment section which need work with a `// TODO:`  
Use jQuery's `.one` for events which only need to run a single time  
Follow the pattern of keeping functions grouped by the functionality  
Use Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) to avoid global variables  
Use the `tap` event instead of the `click` event  
Use `console.log` or `console.error` to make detecting issues easier  
Create guard conditions at the beginning of functions which expect data classes as arguments  
Use only id as the jQuery selector if possible for best performance
